# SMU_Bootcamp_2023_HW_14
Module 14 Belly-Button-Challenge
by John Banowsky

This activity is the SMU Boot Camp Module 14 Challenge.
All code was resourced from the SMU Boot Camp Class.

Programs used:
Visual Studio Code
GitHub

Background:
"In this assignment, you will build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity datasetLinks to an external site., which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare."

I uploaded a dashboard static page to GitHub using Javascript and a JSON file. 

******
I started by using the D3 Library to read the samples.json file. 

I used javascript functions to create a bar chart, bubble chart and gauge chart as well as a display for demographic data. All of these are activated by reading and ID name using a drop down menu. 
The charts were made using plotly charts.
